## Internship

I did an internship at the end of my first year of master 1. The subject was to try to mix monitoring and profiling in the same tool for HPC systems in order to reduce the overhead of running multiple tools on the same system. I worked in the DATAMOVE team at the LiG (grenoble computer science lab). I was supervised by Olivier Richard. I was required to write a report and to defend my work in front of a jury.

This internship was an opportunity for me to discover the environment of computer science research as well as some of the HPC tools and the specific issues of HPC systems. I also learned the Rust language as my supervisor wanted the proof of concept to be developped in Rust for efficiency reasons. A large part of my internship was dedicated to performance experiments. For these, I learned with the help of my team members to design correct experiment plans with repeated configurations in a randomized order. I also learned the R language to analyse the results of my experiments and plot some graphs. 

The final report for this internship can be found [here](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03773464/document)

## Research interest
 
My research interest lies in the design of kernels for the operating systems of the computing nodes of HPC systems. It can be the tuning of Linux to suit HPC use cases or the use of lightweight kernels. 

One scientific proposition that really inspires me is IHK/McKernel designed at RIKEN where a lightweight kernel is used as a co-kernel to the usual Linux kernel and some operations are directed to this co-kernel to speed up the execution.

Other topics that would interest me are related to filesystems for the HPC, to high performance networks for HPC systems and more generally to topics related to the architecture of HPC systems.

Studying the tuning of Linux or the design of specific kernels for Cloud use-cases could also be interesting.
