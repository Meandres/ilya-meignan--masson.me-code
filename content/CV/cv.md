## Tuition

### 2022/2023 (This year)

Secod year of Master of Science of Informatics at Grenoble (Mosig) at Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France. I chose the Distributed computing path. 

 Courses included : Advanced parallel systems, Cloud computing : from infrastructures to applications, Large scale data-management and distributed systems and Scientific Methodology and Experimental Evaluation.
I also chose GPU Programming in the Data science path.

### 2021/2022

First year of Mosig at Université Grenoble Alpes. This program is entirely taught in English and research oriented. Some courses are dedicated to an introduction to the environment, the tools as well as the ethics of research. On top of that, the program is composed of a mandatory research internship in Grenoble labs. Mine is described in the following section.

Courses included : Principles of Operating systems, Introduction to distributed systems, Computer network principles, Parallel Algorithms and Programming, Software engineering and many other that are less relevant to my research interest.

At the end of the first semester, I worked on a programming project for one month with a team of 5 students. The subject was to start from a MIPS machine with no virtual memory, a single process and only a kernel mode of execution and to build a prototype of operating systems with virtual memory, concurrent processes and threads, user mode, network, filesystem as well as some operating system tooling like locks, signals. We also implemented a basic shell to test our features.

### 2020/2021

Licence (last year of Bachelor in France) major in Computer Science at Université de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.

Courses included : Databases, Introduction to operating systems, Graph theory, functional and logical programming, Formal languages and compilers, Backend web developpement, Linux systems and network administration and others.

### 2018/2020

DEUG (first two years of Bachelor in France) major in Mathematics and Computer Science at Université de Bourgogne.

Math courses included : real and complex analysis, matrix algebra, probability theory, fundamental structures (group, ring, ...) theory

Computer science courses included : Introduction to programming (in Java), algorithmics, introduction to complexity theory, Object-Oriented Programming (in Java), Introduction to System programming (in C), front-end web developpement.

Second semester of the second year in exchange with Erasmus in ELTE University, Budapest, Hungary. The courses were in English. This semester was the start of the Covid outbreak so I couldn't stay in Hungary but I still followed the courses remotely.

### 2018 

Baccalauréat Scientifique (french high-school diploma with scientific courses) obtained with a GPA of 16.31 in Lycée Carnot in Dijon, France.
Options in Science for the engineer (electronics and physics) and introduction to programming (in Python).

### Natural language proficiency

I am fluent in french (mother tongue) and english. I passed an IELTS (academic) test in september 2020 which certified my proficiency with a average score of 7/9. 

I am also at an intermediate level in spanish and a beginner level in Japanese.

## Internship

I did an internship at the end of my first year of master 1. The subject was to try to mix monitoring and profiling in the same tool for HPC systems in order to reduce the overhead of running multiple tools on the same system. I worked in the DATAMOVE team at the LiG (grenoble computer science lab). I was supervised by Olivier Richard. 

This internship was an opportunity for me to discover the environment of computer science research as well as some of the HPC tools and the specific issues of HPC systems. I also learned the Rust language as my supervisor wanted the proof of concept to be developped in Rust for efficiency reasons. A large part of my internship was dedicated to performance experiments. For these, I learned with the help of my team members to design correct experiment plans with repeated configurations in a randomized order. I also learned the R language to analyse the results of my experiments and plot some graphs. 

The final report for this internship can be found here : 

## Research interest
 
My research interest lies in the design of kernels for the operating systems of the computing nodes of HPC systems. It can be the tuning of Linux to suit HPC use cases or the use of lightweight kernels. 

One scientific proposition that really inspires me is IHK/McKernel designed at RIKEN where a lightweight kernel is used as a co-kernel to the usual Linux kernel and some operations are directed to this co-kernel to speed up the execution.

Other topics that would interest me are related to filesystems for the HPC, to high performance networks for HPC systems and more generally to topics related to the architecture of HPC systems.

I would also like to study the tuning of Linux or the design of specific kernels for Cloud use-cases.
