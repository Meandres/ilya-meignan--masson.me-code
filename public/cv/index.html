This program is entirely taught in English and research oriented. Some courses are dedicated to an introduction to the environment, the tools as well as the ethics of research. For the second year, I chose the Distributed computing path.<p>Courses included :<ul><li>Advanced parallel systems<li>Cloud computing : from infrastructures to applications<li>Large scale data-management and distributed systems<li>System Design: Concurrency, Real-Time, Stochastics, and Analog/Digital<li>Scientific Methodology and Experimental Evaluation.</ul><p>For more information, please refer to <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://mosig.imag.fr/DC/DC target=_blank>the website of the program</a><h3 id=2021-2022>2021/2022</h3><p>First year of Mosig at Université Grenoble Alpes. Research internship at the end of the year (see <a href=https://ilya-meignan--masson.me/research/#>research</a>).<p>Relevant courses (among others) :<ul><li>Principles of Operating systems<li>Introduction to distributed systems<li>Computer network principles<li>Parallel Algorithms and Programming</ul><p>At the end of the first semester, I worked on a programming project for one month with a team of 5 students. The subject was to start from a MIPS machine with no virtual memory, a single process and only a kernel mode of execution and to build a prototype of operating systems with virtual memory, concurrent processes and threads, user mode, network, filesystem as well as some operating system tooling like locks or IPC. We also implemented a basic shell to test our features.<h3 id=2018-2021>2018/2021</h3><p>Bachelor of Computer Science at Université de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.<p>Second semester of the second year in exchange with Erasmus in ELTE University, Budapest, Hungary. The courses were in English. This semester was the start of the Covid outbreak so I couldn’t stay in Hungary but I still followed the courses remotely.<h3 id=2018>2018</h3><p>Baccalauréat Scientifique (french high-school diploma with scientific courses) in Lycée Carnot in Dijon, France.
